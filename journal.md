## Phase 6: Register State Persistence ✅ COMPLETE

### Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive register state persistence in project files with automatic disassembly centering on load.

### Completed Features

#### Register State Management
- **Project Save Operations**: 
  - SaveProject method now captures current CPU state from emulator service
  - SaveProjectAs method also includes CPU state persistence
  - All 23 registers saved: D0-D7, A0-A6, PC, SR, USP, SSP, VBR, SFC, DFC, CCR

#### Project Load Operations
- **Register State Restoration**: 
  - LoadProject method restores saved CPU state to emulator
  - Automatic refresh of all register displays in UI
  - Emulator state synchronized with restored register values

#### Disassembly Navigation
- **Auto-Centering**: 
  - Disassembly pane automatically centers on restored PC value
  - CurrentInstructionChanged event triggered after short delay
  - Smooth navigation to current instruction after project load

### Technical Implementation

#### Key Code Changes
1. **MainViewModel.cs SaveProject()**: Added CPU state capture before save
   ```csharp
   var currentCpuState = _emulatorService.GetCpuState();
   _projectService.SetSavedCpuState(currentCpuState);
   ```

2. **MainViewModel.cs LoadProject()**: Added CPU state restoration with UI update
   ```csharp
   var savedCpuState = _projectService.GetSavedCpuState();
   if (savedCpuState != null)
   {
       _emulatorService.SetCpuState(savedCpuState);
       RefreshAllRegisters();
       // Async disassembly centering with CurrentInstructionChanged event
   }
   ```

3. **Infrastructure Reuse**: Leveraged existing CpuStateConfig serialization framework

### User Benefits
- **Complete State Preservation**: All register values preserved across project sessions  
- **Seamless Workflow**: Projects restore exactly where debugging left off
- **Visual Continuity**: Disassembly automatically shows current instruction location
- **No Data Loss**: Comprehensive register state included in project files

### Technical Quality
- ✅ Build successful with no compilation errors
- ✅ Existing CpuStateConfig infrastructure properly utilized  
- ✅ Asynchronous UI updates prevent blocking
- ✅ Event-driven architecture maintained for disassembly updates

## Next Phase: User Interface Implementation

Phase 3 will focus on implementing the main application UI with the following planned components:
- Main window with CPU state display
- Memory viewer and editor
- Disassembly view with syntax highlighting
- Execution control buttons and status
- Breakpoint management interface
- Project file management UI
