# Journal

I started by creating the requirements and design markdown files in the specs directory, and gave Claude Sonnet 4 this prompt:

> We are going to create the application described in the requirements.md and design.md files. What other aspects of the requirements or design should be added to these documents before we begin?

Claude pointed out some stuff that needed to be specified more clearly, so I added a bunch of stuff to the 'requirements' file - it roughly doubled in size.

I should have added those initial versions to git, but didn't think about version control until later.
