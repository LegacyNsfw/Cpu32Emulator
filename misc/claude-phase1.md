## Phase 1 Implementation Complete ✅

I've successfully implemented Phase 1 of the CPU32 Emulator project. Here's what was accomplished:

### Project Foundation
- ✅ Created Uno Platform solution structure targeting WPF and GTK
- ✅ Configured .NET 8 with MVVM pattern and dependency injection
- ✅ Added Unicorn Engine 2.1.3 NuGet package for CPU emulation
- ✅ Set up proper .gitignore and committed initial structure

### Core Models Implemented
- ✅ **CpuState**: Complete 68K register management (D0-D7, A0-A6, USP, PC, CCR, SSP, SR, VBR, SFC, DFC)
- ✅ **MemoryRegion**: ROM/RAM region handling with read/write operations
- ✅ **WatchedMemory**: Memory watch entries with byte/word/long support
- ✅ **ProjectConfig**: JSON serializable project configuration
- ✅ **LstEntry**: LST file parsing with instruction detection

### Core Services Implemented
- ✅ **UnicornEmulatorService**: Complete wrapper for Unicorn engine with M68K support
- ✅ **FileService**: Async file I/O for ROM, RAM, LST, and project files
- ✅ **DisassemblyService**: LST file management with address mapping and navigation
- ✅ **ProjectService**: Complete project lifecycle with save/load/validation

### Technical Achievements
- ✅ Project builds successfully without errors
- ✅ All services properly handle exceptions and provide error information
- ✅ Complete JSON serialization support for project persistence
- ✅ Proper async/await patterns throughout
- ✅ Comprehensive validation and error handling
- ✅ Memory safety with proper IDisposable implementation

### Next Steps
The foundation is solid and ready for Phase 2 (Core Emulation Engine). All the data models and services needed for the emulator core are in place and tested through successful compilation.
