I'll read the updated requirements and design documents to understand the current state, then provide a comprehensive implementation plan. Based on the updated requirements and design documents, here's a comprehensive implementation plan for the CPU32 Emulator application:

# Implementation Plan for CPU32 Emulator

## Phase 1: Project Foundation & Architecture (Week 1)

### 1.1 Project Setup
- Create Uno Platform solution structure using Visual Studio templates
- Configure project for .NET 8 targeting
- Set up NuGet packages:
  - Uno Platform 5.6.37
  - Unicorn Engine C# bindings
  - JSON serialization (System.Text.Json)
- Initialize Git repository with proper .gitignore

### 1.2 Core Architecture
- **Models/Data Layer:**
  - `CpuState` class for managing 68K registers (D0-D7, A0-A6, USP, PC, CCR, SSP, SR, VBR, SFC, DFC)
  - `MemoryRegion` class for ROM/RAM regions
  - `ProjectConfig` class for JSON serialization
  - `WatchedMemory` class for memory watch entries
  - `LstEntry` class for LST file parsing

- **Services Layer:**
  - `UnicornEmulatorService` - wraps Unicorn engine
  - `FileService` - handles ROM/RAM/LST/project file operations
  - `DisassemblyService` - manages LST parsing and display
  - `ProjectService` - manages project save/load

## Phase 2: Core Emulation Engine (Week 2)

## Phase 4: Register Display (Week 4)

### 4.1 Register Pane
- Create data-bound register display grid

- Add register value change highlighting
- Handle PC register changes to update disassembly view
- Format all registers in hexadecimal display

### 4.2 Register Management
- Sync register values with Unicorn engine
- Implement register modification with validation
- Add undo/redo for register changes

## Phase 5: Memory Watch Window (Week 5)

### 5.1 Memory Pane
- Create memory watch grid with address/value columns
- Implement double-click editing for addresses and values
- Add data width selection (byte/word/long)
- Handle ROM vs RAM write permissions
- Add special "RESET" pseudo-address row

### 5.2 Memory Operations
- Implement memory read/write with proper data width handling
- Add memory value validation and error handling
- Create memory address navigation helpers

## Phase 6: Disassembly Display (Week 6)

### 6.1 LST File Integration
- Implement LST file parser for format: `segment:address\tsymbol\tinstruction`
- Create disassembly display with scrolling
- Add current PC indicator highlighting
- Implement smooth scrolling to center current instruction

### 6.2 Navigation
- Add address-based navigation
- Implement scroll-to-address functionality
- Handle PC register changes to update view
- Add breakpoint visual indicators (preparation for F9 support)

## Phase 7: Execution Control (Week 7)

### 7.1 Hotkey Implementation
- **F11 (Step Into):** Single instruction execution with full display update
- **F10 (Step Over):** JSR-aware stepping with subroutine skip logic
- **F5 (Run):** Continuous execution until breakpoint (basic implementation)
- **F9 (Toggle Breakpoint):** Breakpoint management system

### 7.2 Execution Loop
- Implement main execution loop:
  - Execute instruction via Unicorn
  - Update register and memory displays
  - Handle exceptions and update status bar
  - Scroll disassembly to current PC
- Add execution state management (running/stopped/error)

## Phase 8: File Operations (Week 8)

### 8.1 Binary File Handling
- Implement ROM/RAM .bin file loading with address selection dialog
- Add file reload functionality
- Handle file validation and error reporting
- Implement proper memory mapping in Unicorn engine

### 8.2 Project Management
- Create JSON project file schema
- Implement project save/load with all settings:
  - ROM/RAM file paths and addresses
  - LST file path
  - Watched memory locations
  - Current execution state
- Add recent files functionality

## Phase 9: Polish & Testing (Week 9)

### 9.1 Error Handling
- Comprehensive exception handling throughout application
- User-friendly error messages and dialogs
- Input validation for all user entries
- Recovery mechanisms for file operation failures

### 9.2 UI Polish
- Keyboard navigation support
- Proper focus management
- Loading indicators for file operations
- Responsive design verification
- Status bar exception reporting with color coding

## Phase 10: Integration & Deployment (Week 10)

### 10.1 Testing
- Unit tests for core services
- Integration tests for emulation engine
- UI automation tests for critical workflows
- Performance testing with large ROM files

### 10.2 Documentation & Deployment
- User documentation
- Developer documentation
- Build and deployment scripts
- Installation packages for target platforms

## Technical Decisions & Assumptions

**Obviously Right Things:**
- Use MVVM pattern with Uno Platform's data binding
- Implement async file operations to prevent UI freezing
- Use hexadecimal display by default for all memory/register values
- Auto-save project state periodically
- Implement proper disposal of Unicorn engine resources

**Areas Needing Clarification:**
1. **Breakpoint persistence:** Should breakpoints be saved in project files?
2. **Memory display format:** Default number of memory watch rows to show?
3. **Exception handling:** Should execution auto-stop on any exception or continue?
4. **File association:** Should .json project files be associated with the application?
5. **Memory limits:** Maximum ROM/RAM file sizes to support?

This plan provides a structured approach to building the application incrementally, with each phase building upon the previous one. The 10-week timeline allows for proper testing and refinement at each stage.
